    	<h2>How to Play</h2>

	<p>
		There are 16 squares on a chess board so there are 16 pieces, well actually this is the european version of chess there can actually be more pieces as explain in the videos above. So there are eight pawns, two castles, two knights, two bishops and one king and queen. In a game the white piece moves first.
