<h2>How to Play</h2>

  <p>
    There are 16 squares on a chess board so there are 16 pieces, well actually this is the european version of chess there can actually be more pieces as explain in the videos above. So there are eight pawns, two castles, two knights, two bishops and one king and queen. In a game the white piece moves first.

    <h3>The Pawn</h3>
    <img src="images/pawn.jpg">
     <p>The pawn is a piece that can only move one space forward except when it is first moved then it can move two spaces. The pawn can only move diagonally when capturing an opponent's piece. Once the pawn has made it across the board the player can trade the piece in for another except the king. The pawn can also be ram, a ram is when the pawn is beening blocked the enemys pawn and neither can move without the help of another piece</p>

    <img src="images/rook.jpg">
     <p>The rook is a piece that can only move horizontally, vertically left and right at anytime. The rook can move anywhere from 1 to 7 spaces in any direction. The rook is the only piece that can particapte in castling move with the king.

  <h3>The Knight</h3>
     <img src="images/knight.jpg">
     <p>The Knight is the only piece that can jump spaces. The Knight piece can move forward, backward, left or right two squares and must then move one square in either perpendicular direction. The Knight piece can move to any position not already inhabited by another piece of the same color.
      The Knight piece can skip over any other pieces to reach its destination position. he Knight also has a unique ability to attack another piece without risking being attacked by the same piece aside from other Knights, of course.

<section class="col-xs-4">
  <h3>The Bishop</h3>
     <img src="images/bishop.jpg">
     <p>The bishop can move in any direction diagonally, so long as it is not obstructed by another piece.
    The bishop piece cannot move past any piece that is obstructing its path.The bishop can take any other piece on the board that is within its bounds of movement. The bishops canonly move on the colored squares they started on</p>
  </section>
<section class="col-xs-4">
     <img src="images/queen.jpg">    
     <p>The queen is consider the most dangerous and agile piece on the board. This piece is the most important, players would most likely sacrifice just about any other piece on the board to save their queen. The queen you could say is like a combination of the rook and the bishop. 
    The queen can move in any direction on a straight or diagonal path.
     queen cannot "jump" over any piece on the board, so its movements are restricted to any direction of unoccupied squares.
    The queen can be used to capture any of your opponent's pieces on the board.</p>
    </section>  
<section class="col-xs-4">
   <h3>The King</h3>
     <img src="images/king.jpg">
     <p>The kings piece is limited in their movement. The king piece can move one single square in any direction.
    The king cannot move onto a square that is currently occupied by a piece from its own team.
    The king piece cannot move to any square that puts them into a "check" position.
    The king piece can participate in a move known as "castling", where the piece can move up to three squares while exchanging places with a rook chess piece.</p>
